# Project Title:

Advanced To Do Web App Using React and Azure

# Industry Type :
Project Description:

Our innovative To-Do list application sets out to redefine task organization and management by leveraging modern technologies and intuitive design principles. Built upon the versatile React framework, the application boasts a sleek and user-friendly interface that ensures a seamless user experience. One of the standout features of our application is the integration of a real-time clock, which provides users with accurate time information directly within the application interface. This real-time clock enhances the utility of the application, allowing users to stay informed about the current time while managing their tasks efficiently.

In addition to the real-time clock, our To-Do list application incorporates a range of intuitive controls to streamline task management. Users have access to a variety of buttons, including clear, complete, and search functionalities, which are seamlessly integrated into the application interface. The clear button enables users to remove all completed tasks or reset the task list, providing a convenient way to declutter and start afresh. The complete button allows users to mark tasks as completed with a single click, streamlining the process of tracking task progress. Meanwhile, the search button empowers users to quickly find specific tasks within their list, enhancing efficiency and productivity.

Furthermore, our application prioritizes user convenience and accessibility by ensuring that these buttons are easily accessible and prominently displayed within the application interface. Whether on desktop or mobile devices, users can effortlessly interact with these controls to manage their tasks effectively. By combining the functionality of a real-time clock with intuitive buttons for task management, our To-Do list application offers a comprehensive solution for users seeking to organize their tasks efficiently and stay productive in their daily lives.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
